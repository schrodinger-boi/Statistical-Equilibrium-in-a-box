# Statistical-Equilibrium-in-a-box
This is my 1st simulation of a real world physics problem using Fortran. The idea was to simulate N particles in a box, with initial condition being all of them located at the left side of the box. The system is allowed to randomly expand into the box, all the way keeping track of number of particles in the left and right sides of the box. After a certain elapsed time, the system reaches equilibrium, where roughly half of the particles are at LHS and the rest half are at RHS of the box. However because of the statistical nature of the system, there are small fluctuations in equilibrium where particles keep moving back and forth and hence the number of particles does not remain fixed.
